          Cycling is a big part of my life, it has given me many adventures and excitement. The feeling you get when riding
          <br />
          through nature makes you feel relaxed and it's a great getaway from everything else in your life. I started cycling
          <br />
          about 2 years ago and have enjoyed it ever since. I'm not a professional cyclist but my record is 50km since I
          <br />
          began cycling which I see as an achievment.
